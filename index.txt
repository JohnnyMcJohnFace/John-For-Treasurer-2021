    <h1>Why Should You Vote For Me?</h1>
    `<p>Although I can't tell you everything, 	&#40;that's what my speech is for,&#41; I would like to tell you one of my main goals for becoming your treasurer.</p>
    `<p>For one, I don't feel that my fellow students have been properly represented during the pandemic. My friends and I have diffidently had more complaints than usual about how the school is being run. One of my goals is to do my part to give middle schoolers their voice back, so to speak. That means coordinating with everyone every step of the way and push for what they want, during my time in office. When I become treasurer, everyone becomes treasurer.</p>

    <h2>Why Run For Treasurer Specifically?</h2>
    `<p>The treasurer is all about money management. Managing cash flow, budgeting, and finnancial planning are a few of the many things a treasurer might be in charge of. Money management is directly tied to math, and as I've said up above, I love math. The role of the treasurer let's me do something that I love and also helps me strive for my goals.</p>
